### Abstract

Frontier AI systems burn through staggering amounts of compute to learn from data that is mostly redundant. The **Z-15 Protocol** introduces a sovereign pre-processing layer that detects and collapses structural redundancy before model training.

Through *Structural Invariant Computation* (SIC), Z-15 isolates a stable invariant set ($\Psi$) from the raw corpus ($C_{raw}$) and folds it into a compact, high-signal representation ($C_{\mathbb{Z}15}$).

### Core Metrics

Across benchmarks, this process yields:

* **Token-Volume Reduction ($\mathcal{C}_V$):** `~58%`
* **Resource-Utilization ROI (RU-ROI):** `6.18x`

The protocol reframes efficiency as an epistemic problem: not how much data a system consumes, but how little it must.
